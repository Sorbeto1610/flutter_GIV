## Description

This project is a dashboard, that represents the data that we have from TMDB [(the movie database) https://www.themoviedb.org/].We decided to focus on the movies that are trending this week and represent relevant data in a way that makes it easier for the user to understand the movies impact and elements that explains the relevance of a movie. 

## Meaning 

The dashboard purpose was to have an overview of what movies are trending, and what defines a movie that is trending. TMDB algorithm to calculate the popularity is not publicly disclosed, but it is based on the *number of votes*, the *average rating*, the *number of views*, *recent activity* and  *social media activity*.  A movie that is trending is not necessarily with a high vote mean, and a movie with a high popularity may not be the one with the highest number of votes. Moreover, the genre was also a starting point for our application , does the genre affect the trending of a movie? Are all the genres trending all the time? What are the genres that are the most trending?  We invite you to try it for yourself and see what analysis you ca take from it!
